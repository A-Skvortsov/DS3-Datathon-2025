# My 2025 DS3 Datathon Models

This repo contains the models my team and I trained for the car evaluation,
car accident and fungi classification datasets of the week-long Datathon 
hosted by the University of Toronto Scarborough's Data Science and
Statistics Society. The datasets are linked below.

We used ensemble models, decision trees, boosting methods and neural networks
(+ experimented with a denoising autoencoder neural net for the fungi image
set).

Shoutout to Lucas, Mingyuan and Tony.
